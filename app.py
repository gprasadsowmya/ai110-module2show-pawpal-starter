Welcome to the PawPal+ starter app.

This file is intentionally thin. It gives you a working Streamlit app so you can start quickly,

Use this app as your interactive demo once your backend classes/functions exist.

- Build a plan/schedule for a day that chooses and orders tasks based on constraints
